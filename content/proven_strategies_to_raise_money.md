 But when you operate like you don’t need funding, investors find you more attractive. Here’s how you can create that scenario:

- **Cut Costs to the Max:** Keep your operations lean. Don’t inflate your staff or burn through cash on marketing.
- **Be Operationally Profitable:** Focus on making your business self-sustaining.
- **Build an MVP with What You Have:** Use limited resources to create a minimum viable product.

- **Create a Buzz:** This urgency makes your round exciting and lines up the investors.
- **Leverage FOMO:** Investors don’t want to miss out. Use this to your advantage by updating them on others’ interest.
